**Full-stack Flask application built in Python & HTML for a Spanish-literature capstone.**
• Implemented Flask routes, Jinja templates, and object-oriented dialogue logic to answer questions on contemporary Spanish texts.
• Integrated HTML/CSS front-end with Python back-end—my first end-to-end web project.
• Presented the app entirely in Spanish to a non-technical audience and earned a perfect score on the final.
